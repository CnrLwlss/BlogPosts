<br/>
<br/>I went for a nice mixed grill and treacle pudding lunch with Katy in the King's Head in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allendale,_Northumberland">Allendale</a>, followed by a sunny afternoon's walk up Finney Hill and on to Stobb's Cross to compensate.  
<br/>
<br/>We watched and listened to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Lapwing">lapwings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Curlew">curlews</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Grouse">grouse</a> singing and flying about.  You can hear lapwings <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/l/lapwing/index.aspx">here</a> and curlews <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/curlew/index.aspx">here</a>.  I've never seen more than one curlew at one time before.  They have become quite rare in Ireland, but I saw about ten today.  We also saw several hares running away from us.
<br/>
<br/>The weather threatened to change for the worse while we were crossing some moorland.  The sky clouded over and it got very windy.  It's a little boggy up there still, though it has been a dry winter.  Many of the paths through the moorland look like they would be fun for mountain biking.
<br/>
<br/>We came across the gruesome evidence of a farmer killing moles.  He had recently strung 20 of their dead bodies on the barbed wire fence around his field. Presumably as a warning to other moles?
