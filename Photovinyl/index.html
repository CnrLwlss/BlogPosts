<body><header><h1>Photovinyl</h1><time datetime="2008-03-08T22:56:00Z">22:56 Saturday 8th March 2008</time></header><article>I've been playing with the flickr API using <a href="http://flickrapi.sourceforge.net/">Beej's Python Flickr API</a> and using some of the circley skills I've developed while making these photovinyl images:
<br/>
<br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchur/2319334950/in/set-72157604075425757/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2086/2319334950_3d5dc8b3f4_m.jpg"/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchur/2319334090/in/set-72157604075425757/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/2319334090_d0ded05f1f_m.jpg"/></a>
<br/>
<br/>You can see many more of them <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchur/sets/72157604075425757/">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>Using the API, I can automatically download a random selection of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/circle/">Squared Circle</a> images, which people have kindly licensed under Creative Commons.  I then slice out the biggest circle possible out of these using some functions I've written in Python, with the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> and <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>.  I then paste these slices together in a pile.  The API also allows me to properly credit the people whose images have been used.  You can see this by clicking on one of the images above.
<br/>
<br/>I have been automagically generating many hundreds of these, and selecting ones I like.  It's quite satisfying.</article></body>
