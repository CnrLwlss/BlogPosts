Discrete, deterministic logistic map
	Really interesting and important, but not what this article is about.

	
	
	NCell' = (r/K)*NCell*(K-NCell)  <-- We can carry out discrete stochastic simulation with this form of the equation, based on mass action kinetics. 
	NCell' = r*NCell*(1-NCell/K)    <-- But we can also have the more traditional form
	
	Either way, hazard function is simply:
	r*NCell*(1-NCell/K)  
	
	Note that the hazard function depends on both r and K.  This is consistent with a regular mass-action kinetics model (outline below).
	
Discrete, stochatic logistic model
	We can think about the construction of the logistic model ODE in a different way: by considering a simple chemical reaction between cells and nutrients, which obeys mass-action kinetics.  We have to make the usual approximations about perfect mixing for this to apply.

	[Cell+Nut]' = 0
	[Cell]+[Nut] = c
	NCell + NNut = c
	NCell(0) + NNut(0) = c
	NCell0 + (K - NCell0) = c
	c = K
	
	NCell + NNut = K
