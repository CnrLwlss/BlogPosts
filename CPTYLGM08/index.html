<body><header><h1>Cath &amp; Phil Tyler playing at the Green Man Festival 2008</h1><time datetime="2008-07-13T12:16:00Z">12:16 Sunday 13th July 2008</time></header><article>The amazing <a href="http://www.cathtyler.net/">Cath &amp; Phil</a> are playing at the <a href="http://www.thegreenmanfestival.co.uk">Green Man</a> this year, on August 15th in the Green Man Café.  It was bloody good <a href="http://cnr.lwlss.net/GreenMan07">last year</a>, despite all the rainings.  The Green Man Café stage was definitely the best place to hear new music.  If you can't wait, or can't make it, their new record, Dumb Supper is out now on <a href="http://www.no-fi.org.uk/">no-fi</a> records, and is for sale at <a href="http://www.altvinyl.com/">alt.vinyl</a> and even in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dumb-Supper-Cath-Phil-Tyler/dp/B0013N4J1E"> this place</a>.

<br/>Well, Cath gave birth early so they didn't make it to the Green Man after all.  Claire wrote extensively about what went on in their absence <a href="http://curlymynci.livejournal.com/4800.html">here</a>.</article></body>
