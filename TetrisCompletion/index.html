<body><header><h1>Tetris</h1><time datetime="2008-07-27T12:03:00Z">12:03 Sunday 27th July 2008</time></header><article>Briefly, on Friday, I spoke with one of the people in my office about playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> on the Nintendo GameBoy.  A few months ago, I had gotten my hands on a GameBoy emulator for my PC.

<br/>So, exhausted after running, and while avoiding writing some code yesterday, I fired it up.  My 14 year old self had trained up to be able to complete Level 9 High 5 (the most fupping hardcore level the game has) fairly regularly.  I played it until this skill returned.  It took about 3 hours solid!
<br/>
<br/>Eventually, I got to see the treat Tetris has for completing this level:

<br/>
<br/>There's also some funky Russian music.  And I was RELEIVED, and a little proud to see it finally, because I was beginning to doubt my ability to beat 14 year old Conor.
<br/>
<br/>Strangely though, while my fingers remembered how to twitch at the appropriate speed to achieve this, I realised that I had a very different view of the game now compared to when I played it all those years ago.  Then, and now, I sort of anthromorphisise the blocks, but whereas previously, I thought of some of them as being friendly, and others out to get me, and make sure I failed to complete the level, this time I thought that they were ALL out to get me.  I didn't like a single one of them.   Previously I would be relieved to get the simplest shapes, the square block or the long block, but now I could see the disadvantages of all of them, and I didn't see any of them as being "good".  Does this mean I am more cynical and paranoid now?  Does it mean I was a dumbass when I was 14?  
<br/>
<br/>I think it does mean I should stop playing again.  At least this time I'm not seeing little blocks falling every time I close my eyes.</article></body>
