<body><header><h1>Running</h1><time datetime="2009-01-12T18:41:00Z">18:41 Monday 12th January 2009</time></header><article>After about 7 years of aching bloody bastard hip every time I run for more than about 10 consecutive minutes, I have discovered a magical (but extremely painful) way to stretch which has been slowly eliminating the problem over the past few months.
<br/>
<br/>On St Stephen's day 2008, I ran the <a href="http://www.athenryac.com/2008-provisional-results">Fields of Athenry 10k</a> in 44 mins 26 seconds (or 22 seconds by my watch).  You'll have to scroll down a long way on that page as I came 150th!  I would kind of like to do that in 40 mins or under, but I'm not sure how feasible that is since a) I was totally exhausted after the race and b) I can't achieve anything like that pace when I go out running on my own.  For instance I have been doing these training runs:
<br/>http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2872248 (8.7km <del>42mins 15s</del> 39mins 42s)
<br/>http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2483939 (5.1km <del>25mins 20s</del> <del>23mins 20s</del> 22mins 45s)
<br/>http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2475705 (5.7km <del>28mins approx.</del> <del>27mins 34s</del> <del>25mins 15s</del>24mins 45s)
<br/>http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2486317 (4.5km 19mins 05s)
<br/>http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=3302305 (7.6km 35mins 10s)
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, I will see how I get on.  40 mins.  That's the goal. </article></body>
