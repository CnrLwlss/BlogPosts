<body><header><h1>Ants</h1><time datetime="2007-08-05T16:57:00Z">16:57 Sunday 5th August 2007</time></header><article>Over the past few days, I have noticed that the ants living in the front wall of my house have been going a bit weird.  Some of them have grown absolutely huge, and have grown wings.  And they crawl slowly up the wall.

<br/>I hope they're not planning to invade my house.  They will get their little ant asses whupped if they try anything cute.  It's a bit alarming how many of them there are sometimes.  Especially if it's sunny.  They seem to like the sun.  
<br/>
<br/>They are a good excuse to try out my new macro extension rings.  Pretty zoomy.  
<br/>
<br/>I have put piles of chilli powder at strategic locations around my house.  Hopefully that will discourage them.</article></body>
