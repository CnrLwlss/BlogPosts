<br/>Our <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/doi/pgen.1001362">article</a> describing a new, high-quality, high-throughput method for carrying out screens using arrays of micro-organisms is published today in <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org">PLoS Genetics</a>.  I'm very pleased to be one of three joint first authors of this article!

<br/>
<br/>We present Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA), which is a robot-driven technology for capturing high-resolution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">growth curves</a> on a genome-wide scale, allowing sensitive differentiation between growth phenotypes of arrays of micro-organisms and inference of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis">genetic interaction strengths</a>.  In this paper we examine the response of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast">brewers yeast</a> to two distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere">telomere</a> disruptions, in combination with independent deletions of all 4300 non-essential genes in the yeast genome.  By doing this we greatly increased our understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere">telomere</a> biology, which is particularly relevant to ageing and cancer.
<br/>
<br/>We are very interested to hear from anybody who might like to carry out QFA screens relevant to their own particular area of biological research, and have recently set up a <a href="http://research.ncl.ac.uk/bioht/">high-throughput screening</a> service at <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/">Newcastle University</a>:
